I've started with https://github.com/marklagendijk/node-pm2-windows-startup and added the excellent  https://github.com/stephenwvickers/node-os-service library to it to make a PM2 Windows service.\r\n\r\nTo install, download from Github, then run:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will need a native Windows C build enviroment setup to compile the os-service module.  \r\n\r\nThen run the following to install the service:\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nnode index.js --add\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a Windows called *Node.JS Process Manager (PM2) Service* - go to your Services list in Control Panel -> Administrative Tools -> Services.  \r\n\r\nYou will need to adjust the user that the service runs under, otherwise it won't be able to find PM2 which is in your user's roaming profile folders.  Go to the service properties, and then the \"Log On\" tab.  Set the user to your account, and restart the service.  \r\n\r\nYou should find that PM2 comes back up with a reboot and can still be controlled from the command line as before.\r\n\r\nTo save the current list of processes that PM2 executes:\r\n``` bash\r\n> pm2 save\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
